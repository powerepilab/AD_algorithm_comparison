Code for "Comparison of methods for algorithmic classification of dementia status in the Health and Retirement Study"

Codes 1 through 3 recrate the training and validation datasets used for assessing the performance of the algorithms, as published in our paper. 
The final piece of code "Construct dataset of existing algorithm classifications for waves 2000-2014_2020_0110" assigns dementia classification using the HW, LKW, Wu, and Crimmins alorithms to participants across HRS waves 2000-2014. We did not provide Hurd classifications here, as the original authors have provided them through the HRS website.
